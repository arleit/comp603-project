To pull: use "git pull origin head" <br>

Order of operations when ready to push files to origin <br>
	1. run a git pull <br>
	2. check to see what changes you have made locally <br>
	3. add all the files you want added <br>

	5. run git push origin head <br>

When a merge conflict occurs, you will have to resolve it. <br>
As long as you pull often, it should not occur too much <br>
